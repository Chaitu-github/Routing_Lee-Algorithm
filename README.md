# Routing_Lee-Algorithm
In the VlSI design process routing follows placement. The objective of the routing is to find and connect a path (wire) between two pins of the same net. There are two broad classes of routing algorithms. Maze routing algorithm and channel routing algorithm.
Lee routing falls under the category of maze routing algorithm.
